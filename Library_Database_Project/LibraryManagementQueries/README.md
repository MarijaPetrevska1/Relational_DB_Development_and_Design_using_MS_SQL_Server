## 📚 Library Database Management System (SQL Project)

This repository contains SQL scripts and exercises based on a YouTube tutorial I followed.
The goal of the project is to practice relational database design, SQL queries, and database concepts such as relationships, constraints, joins, aggregate functions, and more.

📌 Project Overview

The project includes:

✅ Database Structure

- Creating tables (Books, Authors, Members, Borrowing, etc.)

- Defining primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships

- Inserting sample data

- Understanding relational modeling

✅ SQL Queries

The repository contains SQL tasks such as:

Simple SELECT queries; Filtering (WHERE); Sorting (ORDER BY); Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN); Aggregation (COUNT, MAX, GROUP BY); Subqueries; Intermediate & advanced SQL challenges; Identifying overdue books; Finding most borrowed books; Working with date functions
And more…

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project helps with:
- Practicing SQL syntax
- Understanding relational databases
- Preparing for interviews
- Studying database design principles
- Strengthening MS SQL Server and MySQL skills

*This is a learning project, but suggestions or improvements are always welcome.*

- Creating a Library Database from scratch
Designing the full structure of the database including tables like Books, Authors, Members, and Borrowing.
- Writing SQL queries for CRUD operations
Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data effectively.
- Designing a database schema for real-world use
Understanding how to structure data properly using keys, constraints, and normalization best practices.
- Implementing relationships between tables
Using primary keys and foreign keys to connect tables and maintain data integrity.
- Running complex SQL queries
Using joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, date calculations, and filtering to get meaningful insights from the data.
