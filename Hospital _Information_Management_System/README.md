# 🏥 Hospital Information Management System (HIMS)

This project is a **Hospital Information Management System** database built using **SQL**.  
It is designed to manage hospital-related data such as patients, doctors, wards, rooms, beds, and medical records in a structured and efficient way.
The project demonstrates practical usage of **relational database design**, **constraints**, and **SQL querying** for real-world applications.
